				<h2> MY TRAVELS ✈️</h2>
				<p>I’ve had the opportunity to visit almost every country in <strong> Europe </strong>, which has fueled my passion for discovering new cultures. One of my best memories is a road trip through <strong> Greece </strong> with my family. More recently, I took my first solo trip to <strong> Canada </strong> for an internship, an experience that made me realize how adaptable I am and how easily I can embrace new environments.</p>

				<h2> MY PROJECTS 🌸 </h2>
				<p> My project is to redesign the <strong>Sysea</strong> website <strong>myself</strong> to avoid paying <strong>monthly fees</strong> for an <strong>external platform</strong>. By creating the site <strong>in-house</strong>, we can <strong>save on costs</strong> while having <strong>full control</strong> over the <strong>features</strong> and <strong>content management</strong>.</p>
